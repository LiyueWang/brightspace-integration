# brightspace-integration

[![Build status][ci-image]][ci-url]
[![Dependency Status][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url]

The goal of this project is to bring together many other external libraries and modules for inclusion into a particular build of Brightspace.

## Building

The first time you build, install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Rebuild assets to the `build` directory:

```shell
npm run build
```

### Troubleshooting on Windows

Building BSI in Windows doesn't always go smoothly. Here are some of the issues that have been encountered, and their potential solutions:

Trouble | Shooting
------------ | -------------
**build:icons fails:** ```cannot copy from `...'images\**\*.*'` to `...'images\**\*.*'`: cannot read from `...'images\**\*.*'`: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '...'images\**\*.*''``` | remove single quotes from `package.json`.`scripts`.`build:icons`
**npm i fails:** ```error: [cli.main]   Promise rejection: Error: Failed to execute "git ls-remote --tags --heads https://github.com/Polymer/polymer.git", exit code of #128 fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'https'``` | Run `git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://` in command prompt

## Running Locally

To test against a local Brightspace environment, first start serving the compiled assets:

```shell
npm run serve
```

This will run a web server on port `8080` pointing at the `build` directory. You'll need to manually rebuild if any of the assets change.

To point your Brightspace instance at the local integration project:

1. Go to your `{instance}/config/Infrastructure` directory
2. Edit `D2L.LP.Web.UI.Html.Bsi.config.json`
3. Change the `daylight-polymer-<version>` property to the `brightspace-integration (BSI)` localhost server (or your computer's hostname) - note the trailing `/`
4. Restart IIS

The config file will get overwritten during the build.

## NPM and Bower Dependency Locking

We use lock files to lock both our NPM and Bower dependencies. This ensures we only pick up changes to dependencies when we explicitly ask for them and are prepared to test them.

### Bower Locking

To install a new dependency or update an existing one:
1. If you haven't already, install `bower-locker` globally using `npm install -g bower-locker`
2. Unlock `bower.json` by running `bower-locker unlock`
3. Make changes to `bower.json` manually or via `bower install <component>`
4. Update dependencies in `bower_components` via `bower update` or by removing the directory and doing a fresh `bower install`
5. Lock `bower.json` again by running `bower-locker lock`
6. Inspect the diff to ensure the changes match your expectations

[Read more in the `bower-locker` documentation...](https://github.com/infusionsoft/bower-locker)

### NPM Locking

Any command that would normally add or update `package.json` will also update `package-lock.json` -- `npm install`, `npm update` etc. Just be cognizant of the changes you're making.

[Read more in the `package-lock` documentation...](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks)

## Web Components

This project serves as an integration point for our web components and we are using [Polymer CLI's](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/toolbox/build-for-production) `build` command to manage common dependencies between components and generate web component bundles.

To integrate a new web component into BSI, perform the following steps:

1. Unlock `bower.json` by following the instructions above for `bower-locker`
2. Reference your component as a bower dependency using the path to the repository plus a version tag (i.e. `bower install --save https://github.com/Brightspace/my-component.git#1.0.0`)
3. Add an HTML file (i.e. `d2l-my-component.html`) to the `web-components` directory that references the new bower component. (i.e. `../bower_components/my-component/my-component.html`)
4. Reference the new html file from the fragments list in  `polymer.json`

## Publishing

The project assets (`build` directory) will be automatically published to the Brightspace CDN by its [Travis CI job](https://travis-ci.org/Brightspace/brightspace-integration) after each successful build of a tagged commit.

The publish location will be: `https://s.brightspace.com/lib/bsi/{version}/`

## Updating LP to reference the new version of BSI

Once you've drafted a new release of BSI, you'll need to update LP to reference your version. Create a PR in LP
that updates the `daylight-polymer-1` line of [D2L.LP.Web.UI.Html.Bsi.config.json](https://git.dev.d2l/projects/CORE/repos/lp/browse/_config/Infrastructure/D2L.LP.Web.UI.Html.Bsi.config.json)

This will ensure that the LP (and new CD builds) are using the latest version of BSI.
